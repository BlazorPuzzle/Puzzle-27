### The Challenge:

We have a list of Blazor Puzzle episodes in a QuickGrid with buttons to get more details about each episode.  We can click the button for an episode and get details, but if we click a second button on the page, nothing happens?

What is the problem with this code?  How would you fix it to enable every button click to work?
